## 🚀 Recommended Deployment Flow

### For Render (Recommended):

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Connect GitHub → Select repository
   - Configure service:
     - Build: `npm install`
     - Start: `npm start`
     - Environment: Node

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/inventory-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   MONGODB_DB_NAME=inventory-tracker
   ```

4. **Update Alexa Skill**:
   - Copy your new Render URL
   - Update Alexa Developer Console endpoint
   - Test with voice commands

## ⚡ Post-Deployment Verification

### Test API Endpoints:
```bash
# Replace YOUR_URL with your deployed app URL
curl https://YOUR_URL.onrender.com/api/inventory
curl -X POST https://YOUR_URL.onrender.com/api/inventory/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"item": "test", "quantity": 1}'
```

### Test Alexa Integration:
1. Open Alexa Developer Console
2. Update skill endpoint to your new URL
3. Test with simulator: "在庫管理を開いて"
4. Try adding items: "にんじんを3個追加した"

### Verify MongoDB:
